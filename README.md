## Hello!

Hello, my name is Evan Zhang!

I'm currently a freshman at Dartmouth College interested in studying Computer Science and Music.  Please feel free to look at around at some of the repos here!

# Private Repos:

I have some projects I've made in C and Java that I have stored as private repos:
Please just let me know if you want access!  (email: evzhang05@gmail.com or evan.l.zhang.27@dartmouth.edu)

## Data Structure Implementation (C):

Implementing a Set, Counter, and Hashtable in C.

## TSE Crawler (C):

First part of making a Tiny Search Engine:
The crawler crawls a website and retrieves webpages starting with a specified URL. It parses the initial webpage, extracts any embedded URLs and retrieves those pages, and crawls the pages found at those URLs, but limits itself to some threshold number of hops from the seed URL, and avoids visiting any given URL more than once. It saves the pages, and the URL and depth for each, in files.

## Viterbi

Program makes use of the Viterbi Algorithm to categorize words into certain parts of speech. Utilizes data from Brown texts to train and test (in test subfolder)

Running Sudi.java enables the user to input words separated by a space and outputs the part of speech each word is.

Ex: Type a few words (separated by a space) to get the order of parts of speech: (input) I like eating chicken every day [PRO, V, VG, N, DET, N]
